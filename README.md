# Hello PWA

TODO:

- Check installed app locations on MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android so we can set proper expectations
- Page design, style cleanup
- Copy, explainer, and README (be sure to explain permissions in various browsers...)
- Add install nudge for uninstalled apps via isInstalledPWA
- Increment badge for notifications (clear on app open)

README STUFF:

- manifest _needs_ "display": "standalone" to work right on iOS!
- doesn't need apple specific stuff in the head â€” manifest is plenty now!
- Helpers: iOS orientation change zoom fix, isInstalledPWA boolean
- Features: push notifications, setting/clearing badges, orientation change detection
- Document https://glitch.com/edit/#!/glortch-pusha-tee
