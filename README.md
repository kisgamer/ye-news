# Hello PWA

TODO:
 - Can service worker AND index.js can read from manifest.json for notification title and app image?
 - Can is there a consistent but randomizable way to set cache name? manifest file hash? (to avoid collisions between remixes if that step is missed)
 - Check installed app locations on MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android so we can set proper expectations
 - How do we add the push server location gracefully?
 - Page design, style cleanup
 - Form labels, accessibility
 - Copy, explainer, and README (be sure to explain permissions in various browsers...)
 - Why isn't the notifications permission check not waiting to fire on mobile safari?
 - Ditch the realtime notifications form and only do push notifications ([https://felixgerschau.com/web-push-notifications-tutorial/](best resource))
 - Add install nudge for uninstalled apps via isInstalledPWA
 
README STUFF:
 - manifest _needs_ "display": "standalone" to work right on iOS!
 - doesn't need apple specific stuff in the head â€” manifest is plenty now!
 - Helpers: iOS orientation change zoom fix, isInstalledPWA boolean
 - Features: realtime notifications, setting/clearing badges, orientation change detection
