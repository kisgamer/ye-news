# Hello PWA

TODO:
 - Can service worker AND index.js can read from manifest.json for notification title?
 - Can is there a consistent but randomizable way to set cache name? manifest file hash? (to avoid collisions between remixes if that step is missed)
 - Read more about the mac/OS level notifications â€” can we customize the URL bit that shows under the title?
 - How do we add the push server location gracefully?
 - Add badging for push notifications (not for local notifications though)
 - Page design, style cleanup
 - Form labels, accessibility
 - Copy, explainer, and README
